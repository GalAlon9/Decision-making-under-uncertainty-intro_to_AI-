HI there,

Make sure that you install the following packages:
1. networkx
2. matplotlib


There are some environment inputs that we already made that you can use or chose to create your own (if so please keep the format of the inputs).

To change the environment inputs, go to main > main function > and change row 177

After that you can run the main file and see the results, you can also choose after the default run to simulate a random world state run
or a one of your own choosing. You will be asked to chose which option and just follow the instructions.

Enjoy :)
